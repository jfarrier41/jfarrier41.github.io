    <p>   Before my brother was born, my mom's doctor kept heavily advising her to abort him.
      He said that it was very unlikely that he would survive birth and if he did he would have 
      extreme dissabilites and would die at a young age and it was impossible he would even make
      it past 19. My mom declined the doctors many offers of abortion and proceeded to give birth 
      to my older brother. He is now 25 and own a construction company that he started when he was 19.
      He was a 3 sport athlete in highschool and has never had any dissabilites. However he was
      probably the most problamtic kid and constantly tested my parents patience throughout middlschool
      and highschool.
