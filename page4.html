    <p>   Veronica was the next child in line. At a young age she learned that if she cooked 
      and hellped clean inside she would not have to do outside work. So instead of working outside
      and helping with the sawmill and wood like many of my siblings, she made many desserts and hellped
      my mom cook dinner. She was not near as sure about getting married as her older sister and 
      contimplated choosing the life of a nun. She went to a nunnary for a brief period of time,
      about 6 months. She discerned out of the nunlife, and is now trying to finish up pt school.
      She is now just as anctious as her older sister was about getting married and having a family of
      her own.
