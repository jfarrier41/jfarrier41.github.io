    <p>  Ciara was the first girl born of the Farrier Family and for as long as I can remember she 
      wanted to have a family of her own. My parents actually homeschooled my siblings for a brief
      period of time because they were so worried about her trying to have a kid at a young age.
      She wished to get married and have kids right after highschool like my parents, but wouldn't 
      get married until she was 27 years old and would have her first boy about a year later. She 
      now has a little girl on the way to add to her family.
